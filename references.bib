	abstract = {Misinformation can be rapidly spread in cyberspace. It thrives in the social media landscape as well as news platforms. Misinformation can readily gain momentum in the race to influence people or intentionally deceive. With the use of bots, misinformation can be easily shared, especially in environments like Twitter and Facebook. While, some measures are taken to stop the spread of misinformation, threats like Deepfakes are posing a higher challenge. Deepfakes provide a means to generate fake digital content in order to impersonate a person. With the use of audio, images and videos, artificial intelligence is used to depict the speech and actions of people. Deepfakes are typically made of presidents or influential businessmen such as Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg. Deep Fakes can be very realistic and convincing as this form of synthetic media is raising concerns about its possible misuse. The effects of Deepfakes are to spread disinformation, confuse users or create influence. This can lead to further effects like political factions, blackmail, harassment and extortion. Deepfakes could lead to a distrust in digital content as many may feel that anything we see is actually just a manipulation. Deepfakes has arisen as a new generation of misinformation through the manipulation of digital media in order to create realistic videos. This paper looks at the governing, communal and technical issues relating to Deepfakes. At the technical level, the use of audio and text analysis used to create Deepfake videos is advancing at a rapid pace which has also made its affordability and accessibility easier. An evaluation of the threats stemming from Deepfakes reveals that there are various mental, monetary and group dynamics involved. In this paper, the various types of threats emanating from Deepfakes is discussed. This paper also looks at five factors in the field of Deepfakes that should be taken into consideration (Technical Source Dissemination Victim Viewers). The paper discussed these five factors in order to help identify measures to help curb the spread of Deepfakes. A combination of these measures can help limit the spread of Deepfakes and support mitigation of the threat. Due to prominence and power that digital media has, it is imperative that this threat not be overlooked. The paper provides a holistic approach to understanding the risk and impact of Deepfakes, as well measures to help mitigate abuse thereof.},

	abstract = {Deepfake, a machine learning-based software tool, has made it easy to alter or manipulate images and videos. Images are frequently used as evidence in investigations and in court. However, technological developments, and deepfake in particular, have potentially made these pieces of evidence unreliable. Altered images and videos are not only surprisingly convincing but are also difficult to identify as fake or real. Deepfakes have been used to blackmail, fake terrorism events, disseminate fake news, defame individuals, and to create political distress. To gain in-depth insight into the deepfake technology, the present research examines its origin and history while assessing how deepfake videos and photos are created. Moreover, the research also focuses on the impact deepfake has made on society in terms of how it has been applied. Different methods have been developed for detecting deepfakes including face detection, multimedia forensics, watermarking, and convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}). Each method uses machine learning, a technique from the field of artificial intelligence, to detect any kind of manipulation in photos and videos.},

	abstract = {ÐAdvanced deep-learning techniques can generate natural and synthetic voices that might be close to someone’s voice. Nevertheless, misuse of such technologies is of great concern. Hence, researchers focus on detecting these malicious synthetic voices, called ªdeepfake speech.º Although many feature extractions and classifications have been proposed, the accuracy of deepfake detection is still unreliable. In addition, most of the current features are computed in the frequency domain. To this end, we conducted experiments to investigate the contribution of two acoustic features and deepfake speech signals. The acoustic features are timbre and shimmer, which represent our auditory perception in the time domain. We point out that eight timbre components and four shimmer components significantly contribute to discriminating deepfake speech from genuine speech. We also propose a method for detecting deepfake speech based on these timbre and shimmer features. The method was evaluated by using a dataset from the Audio Deep Synthesis Detection Challenge ({ADD} 2022). The results suggest that combining these eight timbre components and four shimmer components with a simple classifier using multilayer perceptron neural networks can enable deepfake speech to be detected potentially effectively.},

	abstract = {Deepfake speech, a misuse of speech technology, is of great concern since it seems natural and is difﬁcult to detect. Although many methods using various speech features have been proposed, deepfake-speech detection accuracy must be improved, especially in real-world scenarios. Therefore, this paper presents a method for detecting deepfake speech on the basis of pathological features used by pathologists for assessing voice quality. The six-pathological features, including jitter, shimmer, harmonicsto-noise ratio, cepstral-harmonics-to-noise ratio, normalized noise energy, and glottal-to-noise excitation ratio, are fed to a multilayer perceptron neural network. We evaluated the proposed method using the Audio Deep Synthesis Detection Challenge dataset. The results indicate that the proposed model can be used for detecting deepfake speech. The proposed method’s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were over 98\% on the development set, and it outperformed the baseline method on the adaptation set.},

	abstract = {Audio content synthesis has stepped into a new era and brought a great threat to daily life since the development of deep learning techniques. The {ASVSpoof} Challenge and the {ADD} Challenge have been launched to motivate the development of Deepfake audio detection algorithms. Currently, the detection models, which consist of front-end feature extractors and back-end classifiers, utilize the physical features mainly, rather than the perceptual features that relate to natural emotions or breathiness. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive study on 16 physical and perceptual features and evaluate their effectiveness in both Track 1 and Track 2 of the {ADD} Challenge. Based on results, {PLP}, as a perceptual feature, outperforms the rest of the features in Track 1, while {CQCC} has the best performance in Track 2. Our experiments demonstrate the significance of perceptual features in detecting Deepfake audios. We also seek to explore the underlying characteristics of features that can distinguish Deepfake audio from a real one. We perform statistical analysis on each feature to show its distribution differences on real and synthesized audios. This paper will provide a potential direction in selecting appropriate feature extraction methods for the future implementation of detection models.},

Using a small voice clip of a person an attacker can develop similar voices. Every audio signal can be represented on a 2D graph plotted by mathematical calculations. The processing of audios into {CNN} requires a lot of computation, to make a system that can detect deepfake voices with much less computation by conversion of audios to images of audio features (Spectrogram, {MFCC}, {FFT}, {STFT} ) and then obtaining the array values as a numeric format which are most suitable to feed. Different approaches for feeding data to model are applied for prediction individually as well as in a concatenated approach.},

	abstract = {Spoofed audio, both human or machine generated, causes deception and disinformation and as such is a societal challenge. This study advances the detection of spoofed audio through a novel approach that augments knowledge about audio data by incorporating linguistic information. Using perceptual methods, for English audio samples, experts in sociolinguistics listened for audio cues, and used binary labels to indicate the perceived authenticity of a set of speech samples, based on phonetic and phonological features that occur frequently in spoken English. These Expert Defined Linguistic Features ({EDLFs}) were then used in supervised spoofed audio detection methods to augment {AI} models. An ensemble method based on multi-domain features both from the audio data itself and the {EDLFs} was also created to evaluate the spoofed audio detection, and to demonstrate how {EDLFs} can improve traditional methods of spoofed audio detection. We found that augmenting the audio data with expertinformed linguistic annotation increased the accuracy of spoofed audio detection significantly in both the training and testing datasets across the evaluated single and ensemble models. Our findings indicate the promising avenue of augmenting audio data with perceptual linguistic techniques, as a method of human discernment, to enhance {AI}-based approaches for spoofed audio detection. These features also establish a foundation for direct linguistic annotations on new audio clips for robust spoofed audio detection.},

While researchers have presented various deep learning models for audio spoofs detection, it is often unclear exactly why these architectures are successful: Preprocessing steps, hyperparameter settings, and the degree of ﬁne-tuning are not consistent across related work. Which factors contribute to success, and which are accidental? In this work, we address this problem: We systematize audio spooﬁng detection by re-implementing and uniformly evaluating twelve architectures from related work.
